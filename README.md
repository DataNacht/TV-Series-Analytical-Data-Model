# TV-Series-Analytical-Data-Model ðŸ“º
An analytical model that helps users determine if a series is worth watching, cancelled, or a top performer.

TV shows become a part of our lives. We create emotional records with our friends and family while watching a TV serie. As a social gathering as it is, I wanted to create an analitical app about ebooks which allows the users to look for a particular TV show of their preference and at the same time alert them whether if it is worth watching or not, so I thought about a few metrics to achieve those goals which I resume above:

* Cancellation risk indicator: Alert that checks if a series was cancelled or has a potential risk of it.
* Quality assessment: Based on users overall rating.
* Viewership trends: Based on a growth or decline of viewers in time.
* Others.
